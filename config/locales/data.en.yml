# See en.yml for general localization information.
#
# This file provides localizations for keys which come from the database.
# TODO: Ideally, these strings would be database driven too, so that they
# could evolve in the Admin without having to deploy a new build.
#
# Note that all the data-driven keys are quoted. Localized keys are converted
# to symbols, but they might not be valid identifies (often include spaces).
