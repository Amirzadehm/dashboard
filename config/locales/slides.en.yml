        text: "Welcome to your first hour of code! I'm Tess, a software engineer at Google. Let's dive right into your first taste of programming."

        text: "We'll be using Blockly, a visual programming language where you drag and drop blocks to write code."
      3:
        image: 'notes/hoc1_3.png'
        text: "Most programs are written with text, and under the hood of the blocks you'll be using is text as well."

        text: "You'll be learning the foundations to computer science, which is used to do so many cool things from creating phone apps to controlling the Mars rover."

        text: "A program is a set of instructions for your computer to follow."
      6:

        text: "We'll be writing programs that get an angry bird through a maze to the bad piggie."
      7:
        image: 'notes/hoc1_7.png'
        text: "In Blocky, the left side is the maze where your program will run. The instructions for each puzzle are written below the maze."
      8:
        image: 'notes/hoc1_8.png'
        text: "The middle is the toolbox which has the commands that the bird understands. You'll use these blocks to build your code."
      9:
        image: 'notes/hoc1_9.png'
        text: "On the right is your workspace where you'll drag and drop blocks from the toolbox to build your program. And the trash is in the upper right-hand corner if you ever want to delete a block."
      10:
        image: 'notes/hoc1_10.png'
        text: "Each block is one instruction. If you drag a \"move forward\" block out to your workspace and press \"Run Program\", the bird moves forward one space on the maze."
      11:
        image: 'notes/hoc1_11.png'
        text: "If you want your bird to do more than one action, drag out another block to your workspace and wait until the orange arrow appears. When you press the \"Run Program\" button, the command that the bird is running on the maze will be highlighted on the workspace."
      12:

        text: "If you run a program and want to fix it and try again, press the \"Reset\" button."

        text: "Hi, I'm Mark! Let's learn about loops."
      2:
        image: 'notes/hoc2_2.png'
        text: "In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get to the pig."
      3:
        image: 'notes/hoc2_3.png'
        text: "And we can use the new \"repeat\" block which is called a loop to help us out."
      4:
        image: 'notes/hoc2_4.png'
        text: "Instead of dragging out 5 \"move forward\" blocks..."
      5:
        image: 'notes/hoc2_5.png'
        text: "We can put the \"move forward\" block inside the \"repeat\" block and write a number in the block to tell it how many times to repeat."
      6:
        image: 'notes/hoc2_6.png'
        text: "And you can put more than one command inside a \"repeat\" block."

        text: "Enjoy using your new \"repeat\" block!"
