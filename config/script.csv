Artist	Level2	1_2		sequence 1	Draw a square, making each side a different color.	
Artist	Level3	1_3		loop 1	Make a square using only 3 blocks.  (Remember that blocks to set color are free.)

Farmer	Level1	karel_1_1	farmer	sequence 1	Help me flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt to remove it.	
Farmer	Level2	karel_1_2	farmer	sequence 1	Move me to the hole and fill it with two shovelfuls of dirt.	
Farmer	Level3	karel_1_3	farmer	loop 1	Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level4	karel_1_4	farmer	loop 1	Make me remove the 4 piles.	
Farmer	Level5	karel_1_5	farmer	conditional 1, loop 1	Make me fill in all the holes. Each hole needs 5 shovelfuls of dirt.	
Farmer	Level6	karel_1_6	farmer	conditional 1, loop 1	Make me remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. Check out the new option in the dropdown menu on the while block.	
Farmer	Level7	karel_1_7	farmer	conditional 1, loop 1	I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt this hole needs. Write a program that makes me fill it until it's even.

Farmer	Level10	karel_1_10	farmer	conditional 2, loop 2	It's nighttime, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove it.	
Farmer	Level11	karel_1_11	farmer	conditional 2, loop 2	It's still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in.

Artist	Level2	2_2		function 1	Use the new &quot;draw a square&quot; block, found in the &quot;Functions&quot; category, to draw a small green square.	
Artist	Level3	2_3		loop 1, function 1	Use the &quot;repeat&quot; block to draw 3 squares of size 100, each 120 degrees apart, in random colors.	
Artist	Level4	2_4		loop 1, function 1	Now change the code to draw 36 squares, each 10 degrees apart.	
Artist	Level5	2_5		function 1	Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 dots.  You'll need lots of blocks.	
Artist	Level6	2_6		loop 3, function 1, variable 1	Modify this program with the &quot;counter&quot; block (found in the Variables category) to draw the same series of squares with fewer blocks than on the previous level.	
Artist	Level7	2_7		loop 3, function 1, variable 1	Replace the pale (disabled) blocks with a &quot;count with&quot; block (in the Loops category) and &quot;counter&quot; block (in the Variables category) to draw the same spiral.

Artist	Level10	2_10		sequence 1	Draw whatever you want.  One idea is experimenting with different types of spirals.  What happens if you change the turn amount, rather than the move amount?	
Farmer	Level1	karel_2_1	farmer	sequence 1	Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and fill in all the holes on the ground.	
Farmer	Level2	karel_2_2	farmer	function 1	Use the new function block called &quot;fill 5&quot; to help me fill in this hole.	
Farmer	Level3	karel_2_3	farmer	loop 2, function 1	Use the function block to make me fill in all the holes.	
Farmer	Level4	karel_2_4	farmer	loop 1, function 2	Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles.	
Farmer	Level5	karel_2_5	farmer	loop 2, function 2	Create a new function that removes 3 shovelfuls from a pile, and use it to help me level out all the piles.	
Farmer	Level6	karel_2_6	farmer	loop 2, function 2	Use the new functions, &quot;fill 8&quot; and &quot;remove 8&quot;, to help me level out the pile and fill in the hole.	
Farmer	Level7	karel_2_7	farmer	function 2	There's a cow in my field! Write a new function that helps me avoid the cow and remove the pile.	
Farmer	Level8	karel_2_8	farmer	function 1, loop 1	Use the function, &quot;avoid the cow and remove 1&quot;, to help me remove all the piles.	
Farmer	Level9	karel_2_9	farmer	conditional 2, function 1, loop 2	Use one of the new functions to help me remove all of the piles on the ground with as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level10	karel_2_10	farmer	conditional 2, function 1, loop 2	Move me across the field, and use the functions to help me remove all the piles and fill all the holes.	
Artist	Level1	3_1		function 1	You can now see how the &quot;draw a square&quot; and &quot;draw a circle&quot; functions are defined.  Defining a function doesn't run its blocks.  You have to pull out the &quot;draw a square&quot; block to actually draw a square.	
Artist	Level2	3_2		function 2	Using the &quot;draw a square&quot; function as an example, create a &quot;draw a triangle&quot; function and use it.	
Artist	Level3	3_3		function 1	Draw triangular fences around the cats and a square fence around the cow.  Tip: Test the program as you go along.	
Artist	Level4	3_4		function 1	See if you can figure out how to use &quot;draw a square&quot; and &quot;draw a triangle&quot; (and some other blocks) to draw a house around the lion.	
Artist	Level5	3_5		function 2	Now create a &quot;draw a house&quot; function and use it house two cats.	
Artist	Level6	3_6		function 2	Using &quot;draw a square&quot; as an example, add an input named &quot;length&quot; to &quot;draw a triangle&quot;.  Then, draw triangles in different colors around the animals.	
Artist	Level7	3_7		function 3	Add a &quot;height&quot; input to &quot;draw a house&quot; and build a big house for the elephant.	
Artist	Level8	3_8		function 3	Here are all of the blocks from the previous level.  Modify &quot;draw a house&quot; so the turtle ends up at the bottom right corner of the new house.  Use this modified function to house all the animals.	
Artist	Level9	3_9		function 1, loop 3	You now know how to control the turtle, use loops (&quot;repeat&quot; and &quot;count from&quot;), and write and use functions.  Congratulations on becoming a programmer!	
Artist	Level10	3_10		conditional 2, loop 2	You're now free to do whatever you want.  One idea is to try running this program with different turn amounts (higher or lower than 90).  Other ideas are to draw a star, circle, heart, or animal.
