Artist	Level1	1_1			I'm a turtle with chalk on my belly. Stack up blocks and press &quot;Run Program&quot; to make me draw the shown picture.	
Artist	Level2	1_2			Draw a square, making each side a different color.	
Artist	Level3	1_3		loop_times	Make a square using only 3 blocks.  (Remember that blocks to set color are free.)	
Artist	Level4	1_4		loop_times	Draw a triangle whose sides are all 100 dots and are in random colors.  You'll have to figure out how far to turn.	
Artist	Level5	1_5		if, loop_times	Draw a triangle and then a square to draw an envelope.

Artist	Level10	1_10		if_else, loop_until	Draw anything you want. Some ideas are a stick figure, snowflake, or spiral.  You could also try out the new &quot;set width&quot; block.  Have fun!	
Artist	Level1	4_1		loop_times	Now you have learned how to draw different shapes, can you create a program that draws the house you made with tangram pieces?

Farmer	Level1	karel_1_1	farmer		Help me flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt to remove it.	
Farmer	Level2	karel_1_2	farmer		Move me to the hole and fill it with two shovelfuls of dirt.	
Farmer	Level3	karel_1_3	farmer	loop_times	Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level4	karel_1_4	farmer	loop_times	Make me remove the 4 piles.	
Farmer	Level5	karel_1_5	farmer	if, loop_times	Make me fill in all the holes. Each hole needs 5 shovelfuls of dirt.	
Farmer	Level6	karel_1_6	farmer	if, loop_times	Make me remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. Check out the new option in the dropdown menu on the while block.	
Farmer	Level7	karel_1_7	farmer	if, loop_times	I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt this hole needs. Write a program that makes me fill it until it's even.

Farmer	Level9	karel_1_9	farmer	if_else, loop_times	Make me remove all the piles, using as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level10	karel_1_10	farmer	if_else, loop_until	It's nighttime, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove it.	
Farmer	Level11	karel_1_11	farmer	if_else, loop_until	It's still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in.	
Artist	Level1	2_1			Find the familiar blocks in the new categories to draw a square in your favorite color.	
Artist	Level2	2_2		function	Use the new &quot;draw a square&quot; block, found in the &quot;Functions&quot; category, to draw a small green square.	
Artist	Level3	2_3		loop_times, function	Use the &quot;repeat&quot; block to draw 3 squares of size 100, each 120 degrees apart, in random colors.	
Artist	Level4	2_4		loop_times, function	Now change the code to draw 36 squares, each 10 degrees apart.	
Artist	Level5	2_5		function	Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 dots.  You'll need lots of blocks.	
Artist	Level6	2_6		loop_for, function, variable 1	Modify this program with the &quot;counter&quot; block (found in the Variables category) to draw the same series of squares with fewer blocks than on the previous level.	
Artist	Level7	2_7		loop_for, function, variable 1	Replace the pale (disabled) blocks with a &quot;count with&quot; block (in the Loops category) and &quot;counter&quot; block (in the Variables category) to draw the same spiral.	
Artist	Level8	2_8		function	Draw three snowmen 150 dots tall in different colors, 100 dots apart.  Use the new &quot;draw a snowman&quot; function and &quot;jump forward&quot; block.	
Artist	Level9	2_9		loop_for, function, variable 1	Use a &quot;count with&quot; loop to draw a family of snowmen with heights of 110, 100, 90, 80, and 70 dots, each 60 dots apart.	
Artist	Level10	2_10			Draw whatever you want.  One idea is experimenting with different types of spirals.  What happens if you change the turn amount, rather than the move amount?	
Farmer	Level1	karel_2_1	farmer		Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and fill in all the holes on the ground.	
Farmer	Level2	karel_2_2	farmer	function	Use the new function block called &quot;fill 5&quot; to help me fill in this hole.	
Farmer	Level3	karel_2_3	farmer	loop_until, function	Use the function block to make me fill in all the holes.	
Farmer	Level4	karel_2_4	farmer	loop_times, parameters	Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles.	
Farmer	Level5	karel_2_5	farmer	loop_until, parameters	Create a new function that removes 3 shovelfuls from a pile, and use it to help me level out all the piles.	
Farmer	Level6	karel_2_6	farmer	loop_until, parameters	Use the new functions, &quot;fill 8&quot; and &quot;remove 8&quot;, to help me level out the pile and fill in the hole.	
Farmer	Level7	karel_2_7	farmer	parameters	There's a cow in my field! Write a new function that helps me avoid the cow and remove the pile.	
Farmer	Level8	karel_2_8	farmer	function, loop_times	Use the function, &quot;avoid the cow and remove 1&quot;, to help me remove all the piles.	
Farmer	Level9	karel_2_9	farmer	if_else, function, loop_until	Use one of the new functions to help me remove all of the piles on the ground with as few blocks as possible.	
Farmer	Level10	karel_2_10	farmer	if_else, function, loop_until	Move me across the field, and use the functions to help me remove all the piles and fill all the holes.	
Artist	Level1	3_1		function	You can now see how the &quot;draw a square&quot; and &quot;draw a circle&quot; functions are defined.  Defining a function doesn't run its blocks.  You have to pull out the &quot;draw a square&quot; block to actually draw a square.	
Artist	Level2	3_2		parameters	Using the &quot;draw a square&quot; function as an example, create a &quot;draw a triangle&quot; function and use it.	
Artist	Level3	3_3		function	Draw triangular fences around the cats and a square fence around the cow.  Tip: Test the program as you go along.	
Artist	Level4	3_4		function	See if you can figure out how to use &quot;draw a square&quot; and &quot;draw a triangle&quot; (and some other blocks) to draw a house around the lion.	
Artist	Level5	3_5		parameters	Now create a &quot;draw a house&quot; function and use it house two cats.	
Artist	Level6	3_6		parameters	Using &quot;draw a square&quot; as an example, add an input named &quot;length&quot; to &quot;draw a triangle&quot;.  Then, draw triangles in different colors around the animals.	
Artist	Level7	3_7		parameters	Add a &quot;height&quot; input to &quot;draw a house&quot; and build a big house for the elephant.	
Artist	Level8	3_8		parameters	Here are all of the blocks from the previous level.  Modify &quot;draw a house&quot; so the turtle ends up at the bottom right corner of the new house.  Use this modified function to house all the animals.	
Artist	Level9	3_9		function, loop_for	You now know how to control the turtle, use loops (&quot;repeat&quot; and &quot;count from&quot;), and write and use functions.  Congratulations on becoming a programmer!	
Artist	Level10	3_10		if_else, loop_until	You're now free to do whatever you want.  One idea is to try running this program with different turn amounts (higher or lower than 90).  Other ideas are to draw a star, circle, heart, or animal.
